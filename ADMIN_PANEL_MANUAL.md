## 📖 1. Introduction & Core Concept

### 1.1 What is Foodelo?
Foodelo is a hyper-local food delivery marketplace that connects three distinct parties:
1.  **Customers:** Who browse and order food.
2.  **Restaurants:** Who prepare the meals.
3.  **Delivery Partners:** Who bridge the gap between the kitchen and the doorstep.

### 1.2 The Power of the Admin Panel
The Admin Panel is the "Brain" of the operation. It is a real-time command center where you can monitor logistics, settle finances, and manage marketing campaigns.

### 1.3 Main Capabilities
*   **Logistics Control:** Real-time GPS tracking of every active delivery.
*   **Financial Settlement:** Automated calculation of commissions, taxes, and payouts.
*   **Content Management:** Full control over menus, banners, and categories.

## 🔐 2. Login & Security Protocols

Your admin account is the most sensitive part of the system. Unauthorized access could lead to financial loss or data breaches.

### 2.1 The Login Process

*   **Session Management:** The system automatically terminates sessions after 60 minutes of inactivity to prevent unauthorized access from abandoned computers.
*   **IP Whitelisting:** For high-security environments, you can restrict admin access to specific Office IP addresses.

### 2.3 Forgot Password
If you forget your password:
1. Click **"Forgot Password?"** on the login screen.
2. Enter your email.
3. Check your inbox for a secure reset link.
4. The link expires in **15 minutes** for security reasons.

## 👥 4. User Management: Moderating the Community

### 4.1 The User List
Every customer registered on Foodelo is listed here. You can search by Name, Phone, or Email.

## 🍴 5. Restaurant Management: Vendor Operations

### 5.1 Onboarding a New Restaurant
This is a multi-step process. Accuracy is critical for tax and legal reasons.

#### Step 1: Basic Information
*   **Store Name:** How it appears to customers.
*   **Primary Contact:** The owner's phone number.
*   **Address:** Physical location for GPS targeting.

#### Step 2: Legal & Financials
*   **GST/Tax ID:** Required for invoicing.

#### Step 3: Operational Settings
*   **Preparation Time:** How long it takes them to cook on average (15m, 30m).
*   **Timings:** Set opening/closing hours. You can even set "Break Times" (e.g., closed between 4 PM and 6 PM).

### 5.2 Approving/Rejecting
When a restaurant applies via the app, they appear in the "Pending" list. You must verify their documents before clicking **"Approve."**

---

## 🛵 6. Delivery Partner (Rider) Management

Our platform uses a unique **"Rider-First" Dispatch Flow** to ensure the fastest delivery.

### 6.1 The Workflow Logic
1. **Customer Places Order:** The system immediately identifies the order details.
2. **System Finds Nearest Rider:** The request is broadcasted to riders within a 3-5km radius.
3. **Rider Receives Notification:** Riders see the estimated earning and distance.
4. **Rider Accepts:** The first rider to accept is assigned.
5. **Restaurant Receives Request:** ONLY after a rider is secured, the restaurant is asked to "Accept & Prepare."
6. **Food Preparation:** The rider heads to the restaurant while the food is being cooked.

### 6.2 Rider Verification (KYC)
Before a rider can work, you must verify:
*   **Government ID:** Aadhaar, SSN, or National ID.
*   **Driving License:** Check the expiry date!
*   **Vehicle RC:** Ensure they have a valid vehicle.

### 6.3 Performance Metrics
*   **Acceptance Rate:** How many requests did they ignore? (High rejection = potential suspension).
*   **Rating:** Average stars given by customers.
*   **Total Earnings:** A summary of their daily and weekly payouts.

### 6.4 Delivery Zones & Payouts
You can divide your city into **Zones**. Riders assigned to "Zone A" will get priority for orders originating in that area.
